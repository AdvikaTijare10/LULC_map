# Project Reflection: Land Use Land Cover (LULC) Mapping

Working on this project has been a truly rewarding experience. It‚Äôs my first dedicated project using **Google Earth Engine**, and I learned a lot along the way.

---

## üß† Challenges Faced

- One of the most challenging parts was manually identifying and marking the training points accurately.
- Initially, I started experimenting on Google Colab, but while exploring further, I realized how useful the Code Editor on GEE is.

---

## üîç Technical Exploration

- I tried different classification models like:
  - **SVM (Support Vector Machine)**
  - **CART (Classification and Regression Trees)**
  - **Random Forest** (which ultimately gave me the best results)
- Learned about:
  - Spectral indices
  - Band combinations
  - Confusion matrix
  - Kappa score

## üí° Key Takeaways

- Beyond coding and analysis, I learned many new technical terms and concepts.
- This project required a lot of **patience, experimentation, and continuous learning**.
- Overall, it was fun and satisfying to see the final classified output map.

### üôå Final Thoughts

This project helped me apply theoretical concepts to real-world data and develop confidence in remote sensing and machine learning techniques. I‚Äôm excited to build on this and try more advanced geospatial projects in the future!
